   ## Installation 

   To use the web application a user must go to the deployed application using the link in [Links](#links)


   ## UserStory

   User Story - As a programmer i want a web application that allows me to generate random passwords that may contain different parameters to more securely  protect my work

   ## Development

   After first creating a basic random password generator that created a password of a defined length without requiring a user input, I evolved the project by developing it further by adding prompts and if else statements in the javascript to allow a user to define the parameters of their password.

   ## Usage

   The user should access the project via the link for the deployed application in [Links](#links) and then click on the Red Generate Password button and make selections based on the prompts, this will lead to the production of the required password at the required length and with the required content.

   ## Screenshots

   yes, this is a placeholder for screenshots to be added

   ## Tests

   produced passwords of multiple lengths and parameters produced by the random password generator
- NKaUXhzltmpwLVnNFgKcxDD - 23 characters, uppercase, lowercase only
- PUA=uv-Fkv}T - 12 characters, uppercase and symbols only
- 5277776331617756996677182217849924141664356043340965708 - 55 number only


   ## Evolution

   During my research i discovered that the use of math.random is no longer viewed as the most secure method for generating a randomised password so this could be altered. Secondly i could add code to protect the prompt box that requests the length of the password to limit a users input so a hacker would be unable to use the box to add their own code into. I could replace the prompts with modals allowing me to create a more user friendly buttons for choosing options. I could make the ui interface differently so a user could use a slide bar to define their password options without having to loop through a series of prompts.

   pod 7 question to Scott Nelson -TA regards final bug that meant that the promptForCharacterTypes function was returning previous values confusing future generated passwords. - solution resetting variable validCharacters to a empty string at the start rather than the end of the function.
